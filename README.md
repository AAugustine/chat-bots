## Projects

### dog-bot
An old Google Apps script bot that generated a random dog picture in Google Hangouts Chat. Relic from my days at Red Hat, where somtimes you just needed to see a random dog to brighten your day. Simple, yet effective.

### Flask AI Chatbot
A web-based chatbot built with Flask and OpenAI API that features:
- Meet Glitch, a chat bot random personality selection for varied responses (because why not add a little fun in while learning?)
- Real-time chat interface
- Error handling and API integration
- Full test coverage
